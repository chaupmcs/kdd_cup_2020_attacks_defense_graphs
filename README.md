**KDDCup 2020 - Track 2 - Adversarial Attacks and Defense on Academic Graph**

https://www.biendata.xyz/competition/kddcup_2020_formal/

The challenge: Submit a modified version of the original dataset as a form of attack that should look similar to the original graph, 
but lowers classification accuracy significantly. All teams are required to submit an attacker and a defender (i.e., a robust Graph Neural Network model). 
The organizers will match all attackers and defenders from all teams and rank the final leaderboard.
