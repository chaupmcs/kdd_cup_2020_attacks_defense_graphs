In the second Regular Track, “Adversarial Attacks and Defense on Academic Graph”, sponsored by BienData, 
requires participants to submit a modified version of the original dataset as a form of attack that should look similar to the original graph, 
but has lower classification accuracy under baseline models. It should be prepared and saved at the backend of the competition system. 
Then, all teams are required to submit an attacker and a defender. 
The organizers will match all attackers and defenders from all teams and rank the final leaderboard.
